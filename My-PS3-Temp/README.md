# My-PS3-Temp

A Tool to manage the PS3 fan speed.

A simple UI, with just the essentials functions to increase and decrease the Fan Speed.
There are also strings to read the actual Temperatures.
I also have included a system to alert you if the temperatures are too high. There are 2 warning message: the first will appear when the temperatures reach 72°, and the second at 75°.

The tool requires webMAN MOD installed on your PS3. It uses PS3Mapi to connect itself to the PS3.
